# IDS - Welcome to SRA module

 <div align="justify"> 
 This module is a part of IDS course providing a general overview of robotics systems for Master's students of [IMT-Nord](http://www.imt-nord-europe.fr) School of Engineering.
 </div>

<div align="justify">
Therefore, the content of this module will open a well-known barrier for students regarding how can I start learning robotics. Structured tutorials based on hardware, such as [Raspberry_Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), software like [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)-[ROS](https://ros.org/), and a project has been designed to give the students a kick start.

## Note

<div align="justify">
The components of a robotic system depend widely on its intended application and functionality. However, this module provides a general overview of the most important elements concerning hardware and software for building simple robotic systems.

## Module tip

<div align="justify">
Be well-prepared to experiment, iterate, and learn from previous mistakes.
 </div>

## Module support

<div align="justify">
The supporting materials for this module can be found at the following links:

## Module evaluation

<div align="justify">
The assessment of this module comprises 20% of the theoretical part and hand-on activities for the remaining %.
 </div>

## Going further

<div align="justify">
Despite the content on the internet for learning robotics, we've put together a project-based module to guide the student as a first step toward becoming a robotic engineer. Based on this philosophy, we do not provide an exhaustive definition of concepts and implementations. Hence, the module relies on Raspberry Pi, as the hardware aspect, and ROS with its documentation/tutorials [docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org) as the software component, for practical sessions.
