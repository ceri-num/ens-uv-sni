# IDS - Welcome to SRA module

This module is a part of IDS course providing a general overview of robotics systems for Master's students of [IMT-Nord](http://www.imt-nord-europe.fr) School of Engineering.

Therefore, the content of this module will open a well-known barrier for students regarding how can I start learning robotics. Structured tutorials based on Linux/[ROS](https://ros.org/) and and a project has been designed to give the students a kick start.

Introduction - [pdf version]()

## Module tip

Be well-prepared to experiment, iterate, and learn from previous mistakes.

## Module support

The supporting materials for this module can be found at the following links:

- On gitbook: link
- On GitHub: link

## Module evaluation

The assessment of this module comprises 20% of the theoretical aspect and hand-on activities for the remaining %.

## Going further

Despite the content on the internet for learning robotics, we've put together a project-based module to guide the student as a first step toward becoming a robotic engineer. Based on this philosophy, we do not provide an exhaustive definition of concepts and implementations. Hence, the module relies mainly on the [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and its documentation/tutorials [docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org) for practical sessions.

You also can find an excellent virtual working environment and resources on[The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/).
