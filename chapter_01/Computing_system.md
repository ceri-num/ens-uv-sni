A typical computing system consists of hardware components, which have been carefully designed to effectively work together, and software components, also known as programs, that run in the system.

## Basic computing systems for robotics

A computing system is one of the integral aspects of robotics. It is well known that many complex computations take place in robotic system to provide the intelligent capability for this kind of system. For this reason, selecting the right computer is essential. 

However, due to the advancement in computing, there are various kinds of computers with enhanced capabilities. Therefore, choosing a good companion computer for a specific robot is not too challenging. 

As this module of SNI course focuses more on providing hands on experience, without a steep learning curve, a Raspberry Pi will be used as the main computer system. 

On the other hand, the operation of a companion computer is often complemented with a separate micro-controller, acting as a a hardware driver, for manipulating electromechanical systems. 

Based on the above philosophy, a quick overview of Raspberry Pi and Arduino will be provided in this part of the module.
