# Basic computing systems for robotics

This tutorial guides you to set up a workspace for developing robotic programs.
We decide to work with Linux-Ubuntu operating system because is a open source os and well supported for many robotic applications.

## Play with Linux

Ubuntu is a distribution Linux (Operating System + Window Managment + Tools) derived from Debian distribution.

It is a classical graphical operating system.
You can explore the system and launch different program to test-it.

In the variety of program, we are mostly interested in the terminal emulator, permitting to manipulate our system directly from command (moving in the directory tree, read and organize files, execute script or programs, administer...).

- **gnome-terminal**: on [help.gnome.org](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable)

Explore the following command (i.e. what for, how to use it). A good way to do this is to first Google the command ([example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=command+man&t=newext&atb=v351-6&ia=web)), then play with the command in your terminal.

- **man**, **ls**, **cp**, **mv**, **cat**, **rm**
- **source**, **apt**, **sudo**

To notice that `tabulation` allows for autocompletion.

More commands: **egrep**, **find**, **ps**, ... ([Wikipedia is your friend](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux_Guide/Linux_commands)).
